            Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləɱ vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] 30 March
            1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is
            among the most famous and influential figures in the history of
            Western art. In just over a decade he created approximately 2100
            artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the
            last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes,
            portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold,
            symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressive
            brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Only
            one of his paintings was known by name to have been sold during his
            lifetime. Van Gogh became famous after his suicide, aged 37, which
            followed years of poverty and mental illness.

            <h2 class="content-heading text-white">LETTERS</h2>
            <p class="content-sub-heading text-white">The Letters of Vincent van Gogh</p>
            <p class="about-text text-white">
              The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is his
              correspondence with younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong
              friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and
              theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they
              exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer
              and provided his brother with financial and emotional support as
              well as access to influential people on the contemporary art
              scene.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text text-white">
              Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him; but Vincent kept only a
              few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow
              Jo Bonger-van Gogh arranged for the publication of some of their
              letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were
              published in 1914. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive,
              have been described as having a "diary-like intimacy", and read in
              parts like autobiography. Translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that
              their publication adds a "fresh dimension to the understanding of
              Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted to us by
              virtually no other painter".
            </p>

            <p class="about-text text-white">
              There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40
              from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister Wil, 58 to the
              painter Anthon van Rappard, 22 to Émile Bernard as well as
              individual letters to Paul Signac, Paul Gauguin, and the critic
              Albert Aurier. Some are illustrated with sketches. Many are
              undated, but art historians have been able to place most in
              chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain,
              mainly with those posted from Arles. While there, Vincent wrote
              around 200 letters in Dutch, French, and English. There is a gap
              in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived
              together and had no need to correspond.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text text-white">
              The highly paid contemporary artist Jules Breton was frequently
              mentioned in Vincent's letters. In 1875 letters to Theo, Vincent
              mentions he saw Breton, discusses the Breton paintings he saw at a
              Salon, and discusses sending one of Breton's books but only on the
              condition that it be returned. In a March 1884 letter to Rappard
              he discusses one of Breton's poems that had inspired one of his
              own paintings. In 1885 he describes Breton's famous work The Song
              of the Lark as being "fine". In March 1880, roughly midway between
              these letters, Van Gogh set out on an 80-kilometre trip on foot to
              meet with Breton in the village of Courrières; however, he was
              apparently intimidated by Breton's success and/or the high wall
              around his estate. He turned around and returned without making
              his presence known. It appears Breton was unaware of Van Gogh or
              his attempted visit. There are no known letters between the two
              artists and Van Gogh is not one of the contemporary artists
              discussed by Breton in his 1891 autobiography Life of an Artist.
